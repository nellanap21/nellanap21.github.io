        <h1 class="heading-style-h1">How to handle closing</h1>

        <p class="text-size-medium">After you have removed all of the contingencies in the real estate 
            purchase contract, you are ready to hold the closing of escrow (aka closing), 
            which is the day you officially become the owner of the property.</p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">At this point, you’ll be working with the Loan Closer at the bank and the 
            Escrow Agent at the title company to make sure the final numbers are correct 
            before wiring the funds and signing the docs. Here are the steps I took to 
            get to closing.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Set a target date for closing</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Ask for the pre-closing statement</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Check the pre-closing statement</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Fix any mistakes</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Double check the pre-closing statement </li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Wire the funds and sign the docs</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Sign the documents</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Closing</li>
        </ol>

        <!--Section on target date-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">1. Set a target date for closing</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Set a target date for closing. You don’t have to close on that 
            exact target date, but it’s helpful to have a deadline for everyone 
            to work towards.</p>

        <!--Section on ask for preclosing statement -->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">2. Ask for the pre-closing statement</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">The pre-closing statement is the final set of calculations for 
            the purchase of the property.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">I started an email chain with Roshon (title company) and Michael 
            (bank) and asked for the pre-closing statement.</p>
        <img src="/assets/close/request-preclosing-statement.png" alt="request preclosing statement">

        <!--Section on check preclosing statement-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">3. Check the pre-closing statement</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">On November 6, I received the estimated pre-closing statement 
            (also known as the Master Statement or Closing Disclosure). 
            This is where you should check that the numbers are correct. </p>

        <!--Section on fix mistakes-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">4. Fix any mistakes</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">The loan coordinator found a mistake in the pre-closing statement. </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">The contract had a seller credit of $16k to pay for our closing 
            costs, but our closing costs were only $13k. As a result, we 
            could only have a $13k seller credit to offset our closing costs. 
            To cover the remainder, we lowered the purchase price by $3k. </p>
        <img src="/assets/close/fix-mistakes.png" alt="fix mistakes">

        <p class="text-size-medium">The next day, we had to sign an additional addendum to paper the 
            change to seller credit and purchase price.  </p>
        <img src="/assets/close/additional-addendum.png" alt="additional addendum">


        <!--Section on double check preclosing statement-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">5. Double check the pre-closing statement</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Once you get the final pre-closing statement (also called the final 
            buyer’s statement), double check the numbers.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">The Financial Consideration is made up of a deposit, loan, 
            down payment, and seller credit</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">County Taxes are pro-rated. The seller paid property taxes for 
            the second half of 2023 so I had to reimburse the seller for 
            property taxes paid from the date of closing to the rest of the year. </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Loan Charges are the closing costs you need to pay the bank. </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Title Charges are the closing costs you need to pay the title company.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Government Charges are government filing fees. </p>
        <img src="/assets/close/preclosing-statement-page-01.png" alt="preclosing statement page 1">

        <p class="text-size-medium">Homeowners Insurance for the first year can be paid as part of closing.  
            The bank will collect your premium as part of closing costs and pay 
            the insurance company. </p>
        
        <img src="/assets/close/preclosing-statement-page-02.png" alt="preclosing statement page 2">

        <!--Section on wire funds-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">6. Wire the funds</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Once you have the final closing statement, you know how much money you need 
            to wire to the escrow agent in order to close.  </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Go to your bank and wire the funds to the escrow agent. The escrow agent will 
            give you the wire instructions. Be really careful here! </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Once you send the wire, email the escrow agent to confirm receipt.</p>
        <img src="/assets/close/wire-funds.png" alt="wire funds">

        <!--Section on sign documents-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">7. Sign the documents</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Now you need to sign the documents in front of a notary who 
            will verify your identity.  </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">The escrow agent can send a notary to you to do the signing, but you can 
            also offer do the signing at the escrow agent’s office. Doing it in person 
            saved me the $200 fee for sending a notary to me. </p>

        <!--Section on closing-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">8. Closing</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">The escrow agent then collects your down payment wire, combines it with 
            the bank’s wire of funds, confirms that everything matches the final 
            closing statement, and sends the money to the seller. </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">This is an example confirmation email that you have officially closed!</p>
