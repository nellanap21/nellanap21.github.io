                                            <p> If you're planning to buy a home, you're going to need to sign a residential purchase agreement. 
                                                The good thing is that the seller's real estate agent can provide the standard residential purchase
                                                agreement, but you still need to understand the key terms.</p>
                                            <p> Chances are you don't have time to become a contract law expert and parse through the legalese.
                                                As a former lawyer who has bought 4 houses, I can help you understand how the residential
                                                purchase agreement works. </p>

                                                        money (your initial deposit) and transfers it to the buyer on the day of closing.

                                                <p> <strong>Initial Deposit</strong> (aka Earnest Money) is the amount of money you must transfer to the 
                                                    escrow agent within 3 days of an accepted offer. This is called "opening the escrow account."
                                                    The deposit counts towards your down payment and is a signal that you are a serious buyer. </p>
                                                <p> <strong>Close of escrow</strong> is the date you officially become the owner of the property. 
                                                    What happens is that the escrow agent transfers the money in the escrow account to the seller and officially 
                                                    closes the account. Typically this is 30 days after your offer is accepted.</p>
                                                <p> <strong>Liquidated Damages</strong> means that if you break the contract,
