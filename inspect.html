        <!--Section on schedule inspections-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">1. Schedule the Inspections</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">After signing the contract, you should schedule inspections as soon as possible 
            because you agreed to a deadline for completing your inspections.  </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">The purchase contract you signed allows you to inspect any physical attributes of 
            the property, and at a minimum you should schedule a home inspection, roof inspection, and pest inspection. </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">If you want to be extra thorough, you can also order a sewer, chimney, 
            foundation, HVAC, and electrical inspection.  </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">You bear the cost of the inspection, but I think it’s always worth the cost. 
            This is the biggest purchase of your life and you need to know if there are any hidden dealbreakers. </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Here is a real life example of the cost for a property we recently purchased. </p>

        <!--Section on attend inspections-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">2. Attend the Inspections</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Although the inspector will typically give you a written report, you should be at the 
            property in person so you can talk to the inspector and ask questions. </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">When we first started house hunting in the SF Bay Area, we found this 
            house on a mountain with amazing views. We fell in love with the property, 
            made a bid, and got a signed contract. </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">We hired a foundation inspector and while we walked the property, he pulled me 
            over and told me about the white pipes sticking out of the hill. I noticed them 
            before but thought nothing of it.  It turns out those pipes were installed for 
            drainage after a previous landslide!</p>

        <!--Section on reviewing disclosures-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">3. Review the reports</h2>

        <p class="text-size-medium">You should read your inspection reports but please note that inspectors are 
            usually very thorough. It’s their job to find as many problems as possible.   </p>
        
        <p class="text-size-medium">Our home inspector recommended that the red “Action Items” are the things we should 
            take care of immediately while blue “Consideration Items” are things that you 
            can take care of later.  </p>

        <!--Section on deciding how to address issues-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">4. Decide how to address issues</h2>

        <h3 class="heading-style-h3">Option A: cancel the contract</h3>

        <p class="text-size-medium">Let’s go back to the example above where I found out about the landslide 
            repair in the back yard. This made me worried about the foundation of the house.</p>
        
        <p class="text-size-medium">But it’s mentally very difficult to change your mind on a house that 
            you bid on, won the contract for, and started thinking about as your home.</p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">However, with storms becoming increasingly severe, I didn’t want to be worried 
            about landslides every time we had a big storm.  </p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">After talking with family, we decided to cancel the contract. See below for 
            how to fill out a form to cancel a contract. </p>

        <img src="/assets/inspect/cancellation-page-01.png" alt="cancellation page 1">

        <p class="text-size-medium">Check the paragraph of the purchase contract that allows you to cancel. 
            In this case, Section 8C refers to the “Investigation of Property” contingency.</p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">Add the title company that serves as your escrow agent. A full release means that 
            you will get your full deposit back. </p>

        <img src="/assets/inspect/cancellation-page-02.png" alt="cancellation page 2">

        <p class="text-size-medium">Both the buyer and seller sign the cancellation form. </p>

        <h3 class="heading-style-h3">Option B: request repairs </h3>

        <p class="text-size-medium">If you find any hidden defects with the property that you weren’t aware of 
            when making the bid, you can ask that the seller make repairs. </p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">However, I don’t recommend this approach because the seller is not 
            incentivized to do a great job on the repairs. </p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">It’s better to take option C to get money from the seller so you 
            can do repairs yourself after closing. </p>

        <h3 class="heading-style-h3">Option C: request concessions</h3>
        
        <p class="text-size-medium">If you find hidden defects with the property, you can ask that 
            the seller cover the cost of repairs.  </p>
        
        <p class="text-size-medium">As an example, in our home inspection, we found a number of hidden defects 
            that showed the house was in much worse shape than a reasonable person 
            would expect.</p>
            
        <p class="text-size-medium">Here are some things that we discovered. For example, we could not 
            have known that the pipes in the crawl space were rusted out or that 
            the 3 prong receptacles were not properly grounded. </p>
        
        <p class="text-size-medium">Tip</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">One of the inspectors actually told our agent that this contractor has 
            a reputation for doing some shoddy cosmetic work right before a sale. 
            It’s really helpful to chat with the inspector. </p>

        <img src="/assets/inspect/inspect-sewer-pipe.png" alt="inspect sewer pipe">
        <p class="text-size-medium">The sewer drain pipe was about to break from rust. Inspector said if he 
            scraped the pipe with a screw driver, it would have created a hole. </p>

        <img src="/assets/inspect/inspect-electrical.png" alt="inspect electrical">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Some electrical receptacles looked to be 3 hole receptacles but they 
            were not properly grounded. They were just 2 prong receptacles with 
            a third hole. Some receptacles were wired backwards. This is a sign 
            of a superficial renovation. </p>

        <img src="/assets/inspect/inspect-air-ducts.png" alt="inspect air ducts">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Some of the air ducts were totally disconnected. Basically, we were 
            heating the crawl space more than the house. </p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">Tip</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">It’s really important that you schedule the inspections as soon as 
            possible because you need to leave time to get quotes for any repairs. 
            With quotes in hand, you are signaling that you legitimately need to and 
            will make these repairs after closing. </p>

        <img src="/assets/inspect/roof-quote.png" alt="roof quote">
        <p class="text-size-medium">This was the quote for a new roof. </p>

        <img src="/assets/inspect/sewer-quote.png" alt="sewer quote">
        <p class="text-size-medium">This was the quote to replace the rusted pipes under the house</p>

        <img src="/assets/inspect/concession-summary.png" alt="concession summary">
        <p class="text-size-medium">After reviewing the inspection reports and getting quotes for the repairs, 
            this is the summary email we sent regarding the request for concessions. </p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">Our original purchase agreement was for $735,000. We then requested a concession 
            of approximately $60,000 to cover the repairs needed for the house. 
            The seller agreed to concession of about $40,000. You have to get this 
            amendment in writing on the proper form. </p>
        
        <img src="/assets/inspect/concession-addendum.png" alt="concession addendum">
        <p class="text-size-medium">We papered the concession by signing an addendum to the purchase agreement.  
            The seller did not have to come out of pocket for the costs because we just 
            reduced the purchase price (by about $25,000) and had seller provide a 
            credit towards closing costs (by about $16,450)</p>
        

        <!--Section on email to sellers-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">5. Send Email to Sellers</h2>

        <p class="text-size-medium">The seller agreed to a credit and price reduction.  </p>
