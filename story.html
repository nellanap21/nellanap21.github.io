                                            <p> Hi, my name is Allen, and I started Home 101 to increase home ownership in the United States. 
                                                I see my mission as teaching Americans everything I know about buying a home. Purchasing a home 
                                                is a key path to building wealth in America, but this American Dream  
                                                has become difficult with high interest rates and prices. The recent NAR settlement 
                                                has created a new opportunity for Americans to buy a home without having to pay 3% commission. 
                                                That's enough for a 3.5% down payment with an FHA loan!</p>

                                            <p> I've been lucky enough to buy 4 homes in my life.  This was because I had to move from New York, 
                                                to New Jersey, and most recently to California. Every time I purchased a home, I learned a ton, 
                                                and that is what I'd like to share with you.</p>

                                            <p>All homeowners have to start somewhere, right? Let’s see how I got started.</p>

                                                <h2>Renting in NYC Sucked</h2>
                                                <p> Ever since I graduated from school and started my first job in 2012, 
                                                    I’ve always wanted to own a home. To me, owning a home is a life achievement and part of the American dream.</p>
                                                <p> At the time, I was living in a New York City apartment. Every year, the building manager would raise the rent by 10-15%, 
                                                    and the only way I could afford rent was to move to worse and worse apartments in the same building. 
                                                    Over 3 years, I moved from 16E, to 10E, and finally to 7B, which was literally the smallest unit on the lowest floor.
                                                </p>
                                            </div>
                                            <div id="the-nyc-co-op" style="scroll-margin-top: 8rem;">
                                                <h2>The NYC co-op</h2>
                                                <p> In 2015, my girlfriend and I wanted to stop paying rent so badly that we bought a small apartment.
                                                    We weren’t even married at the time. Not having to pay for a wedding at that time helped with the down payment. 😊
                                                </p>
                                                <p> I loved that 700 sq ft apartment. Sure, the windows were drafty and the view was of the 
                                                    brick wall next door, but it was a relief to have a place I could call my own. </p>

                                                <h2>The NJ house that changed my life</h2>
                                                <p> By 2021, I got married and had a baby.  Our 1 bedroom apartment wasn’t going to be big enough, 
                                                    so we bought a house in the New Jersey suburbs. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p> For the first time in my life, I truly understood the power of owning your own home. It gave me 
                                                    peace of mind knowing I had a place to live and raise a family. And the freedom to do what I 
                                                    wanted on my land like creating my own bon fire.</p>
                                                <p> It also gave me financial security. Mortgage payments felt way better than rent because the 
                                                    monthly payments on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage were never going to go up. This was huge 
                                                    safety net when inflation hit and although I had a monthly mortgage payment, I knew that 
                                                    part of that payment was paying down the loan (which is basically saving for retirement).</p>

                                                <p> Less than 1 year later, I had to move to California and find a new house on short notice. 
                                                    I remember arriving in San Francisco on a Saturday and going to open houses on Sunday.  
                                                </p>
                                                <p> I quickly put a bid on a house and got an accepted offer. However, I learned a lot about 
                                                    my rights as a buyer when I discovered a previous landslide in the backyard and made 
                                                    the difficult decision to exercise a contingency to back out of the signed contract.
                                                </p>
                                                <p> I ended up buying a different house off-market that needed a lot of work. We saved 
                                                    a lot of money by buying a fixer and doing a lot of the renovation ourselves.
                                                </p>

                                                <h2>The second home</h2>
                                                <p> Last year, I bought a second home because I wanted a place where my parents 
                                                    could live nearby and help out with the kid. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p> My experience buying the first 3 homes taught me to run a thorough inspection process. 
                                                    I found hidden problems and convinced the seller to reduce the purchase price 
                                                    by $40,000 so we could pay for the repairs.
                                                </p>
