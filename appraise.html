        <h1 class="heading-style-h1">How to handle appraisal contingency</h1>

        <p class="text-size-medium">The appraisal contingency covers to the actual value of the property you 
            want to buy.  If the property appraises for less than the purchase price, 
            then bank won’t give you the full amount of the mortgage and you won’t 
            be obligated to close.</p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">Here is how I handled the appraisal contingency. </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Check that bank ordered an appraisal</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Get the actual appraisal report</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Review the report</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="text-size-medium">Let's take it from the top</p>

        <!--Section on check bank ordered appraisal-->

        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">1. check that bank ordered an appraisal</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">This is an example email that you can send.  Our contract was fully 
            signed on October 11 and the follow-up email was sent on October 19. </p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">If you haven’t heard anything about an appraisal one week after 
            signing, send a follow-up email</p>

        <!--Section on get appraisal report-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">2. get the actual appraisal report</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">In our case, the bank had already ordered the appraisal 
            and got the report back.</p>
        <img src="/assets/appraise/get-appraisal.png" alt="get appraisal">

        <!--Section on review report-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">3. review the report</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">This is our appraisal report. 
            The only number you care about is the final valuation.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Page 1 describes the property, the contract, the neighborhood, site, 
            and home improvements.</p>
        
        <img src="/assets/appraise/appraisal-page-01.png" alt="appraisal page 1">

        <p class="text-size-medium">Page 2 describes how the appraiser did an analysis of comparable 
            home sales to arrive at a market valuation of $735,000. The highlight 
            section is the most important part of the appraisal report. </p>

        <!--Section on valuation at or above price-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">Scenario 1: Valuation comes in at or above price</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">If the valuation came in at or above the purchase price, then everything 
            is good and there is nothing else for you to do. You can now remove 
            the appraisal contingency by filling out a contingency removal form.</p>

        <p class="text-size-medium">This is an example of how you would fill out a contingency removal form.</p>

        <!--Section on valuation below price-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">Scenario 2: Valuation comes in below price </h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">If the appraised value is less than the purchase price, you can either 
            (1) make up the difference in cash, (2) cancel the deal, or (3) get the 
            seller to lower the price to the appraised value. </p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">This is an example how you would fill out the cancellation form. </p>
