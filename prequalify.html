        <h1 class="heading-style-h1">How to get preapproval</h1>

        <p class="text-size-medium">The first step in buying a home is to get a pre-approval letter from the bank.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">During the pre-approval process, you’ll fill out an application and provide 
            documents to verify financial information in the application. Then the 
            underwriter will look at your income, assets, and credit score to determine 
            how much you can borrow.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">There is a big difference between a pre-approval and a pre-qualification.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">A pre-qualification can be obtained by filling out a quick form 
            and simply estimates how much you may be able to borrow. A pre-approval letter 
            is only obtained after an initial underwriting, so a pre-approval will make your 
            bid stronger than a pre-qualification letter.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Here are the steps to a pre-approval letter. </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Fill out the application</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Gather the supplemental docs</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Provide follow-up docs</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Get an offer for how much you can borrow</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Ask for the pre-approval letter </li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Review your pre-approval letter</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="text-size-medium">Let's take it from the top</p>
        <img src="" alt="graphic of steps">


        <!--Section on Fill out the application-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">1. Fill out the application</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">In order for the bank to begin working on your preapproval letter, 
            you need to provide a completed application, as well as some supporting documents.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Here is my completed application so you can see exactly what I had to provide.</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-01.png" alt="application-page1">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 1a is all about your personal information.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Check Joint Credit if you and your spouse are both going to be borrowers. 
            You’ll both need to provide info for both borrowers.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 1b is about your current employment</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-02.png" alt="application-page2">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 1c also includes self employment, previous employment, and other sources of income.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">List as many sources of incomes as possible to strengthen your application.  
            Here we listed rental income from our two other properties.</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-03.png" alt="application-page3">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 2 is about your net worth. You have to list out your assets and liabilities.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">For assets, include every bank, retirement, and other account.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">For liabilities, include any debt you currently owe (car, student loan, credit cards).</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-04.png" alt="application-page4">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 3 is about any real estate that you own. For any rental properties 
            list your monthly rental income.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">For the property value, I listed the current price on Zillow or Redfin (whichever one was higher).</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-05.png" alt="application-page5">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 4 is about the property you want to purchase.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">You have to list whether you will be living in the property as a primary residence or renting it out.</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-06.png" alt="application-page6">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 5 is about how you will use the property and where you will be getting the funding.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">If you are borrowing money or getting a gift for the down payment, you’ll have to note that here.</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-07.png" alt="application-page7">
        <p class="text-size-medium">The acknowledgements in Section 6 are where you promise that all of the information 
            you provided is true, accurate, and complete</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-08.png" alt="application-page8">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 7 is where you can list your military service.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 8 is where you can provide your demographic information. You can decline to answer 
            this if you don’t want to fill it out.</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-09.png" alt="application-page9">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Section 9 is information about the loan originator. You don’t need to fill this out.</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-10.png" alt="application-page10">
        <p class="text-size-medium">When you have a joint borrower, you fill out a separate form for the additional borrower.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Include your personal and employment information.</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-11.png" alt="application-page11">
        <p class="text-size-medium">You won’t need to repeat your assets, liabilities, and real estate because it is 
            the same as the primary borrower. </p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-12.png" alt="application-page12">
        <p class="text-size-medium">For Section 5, you do have to make these declarations again for the additional borrower.</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/application-page-13.png" alt="application-page13">
        <p class="text-size-medium">Finally, Section 8 is optional and Section 9 is completed by the bank.</p>



        <!--Section on Gather supplemental docs-->

        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">2. Gather the supplemental docs</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Here is the list of documents we needed as support for the application.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Supplementary Documents/Items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="text-size-medium">W2 from the past two years for all applicants</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Recent paystub and year-end paystubs for 2021 band 2022 for all applicants</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Statements for assets and liabilities held outside of Citi (bank account, 
                brokerage, retirement, loans, etc.)</li>
            <li class="text-size-medium">Schedule E for any investment real estate holdings</li>
        </ul>


        <!--Section on followup docs-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">3. Provide follow-up docs</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">After you have submitted the loan application, you might receive additional questions or document requests.</p>
        
        <img src="/assets/prequalify/prequalify-followup-email.png" alt="prequalify-followup-email">


        <!--Section on offer for how much you can borrow-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">4. Get an offer for how much you can borrow</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Then the bank will actually give you an amount that they are willing to lend you.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">In this case, we wanted to borrow more but the bank was only willing to lend $500k.</p>

        <img src="/assets/prequalify/prequalify-offer-for-borrowing.png" alt="prequalify-offer-for-borrowing">

        <!--Section on ask for pre-approval letter-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">5. Ask for the pre-approval letter</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Once you have found a home you want to bid on, ask for a pre-approval 
            letter in the exact amount of the amount you plan to borrow.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">Here is how we asked for the pre-approval letter.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">You can get pre-approval letters with a couple different amounts and then use the one you want.</p>
        <img src="/assets/prequalify/ask-for-letter.png" alt="ask for letter">
       
        <!--Section on review pre-approval letter-->
        <h2 class="heading-style-h2">6. Review your pre-approval letter</h2>
        <p class="text-size-medium">This is the actual document we received from the bank and used to submit the bid for the property.</p>
        <p class="text-size-medium">One silly mistake I made was to not push for a pre-approval letter. 
            This is technically a pre-qualification letter.</p>
